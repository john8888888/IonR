The settings for the server are defined under the global config screen (Torrent Browser > Config > Plugins > FTPPush (config link). The plugin can be set to run automatically at the completion of analysis by enabling auto-run in which case the default settings are used or can be run manually where the default settings are pulled in, but can be modified for that single instance if needed. \r\n\r\nThe plugin will create a folder in whatever folder has been specified to upload to after then name of the run and the SFF / FASTQ / BAM files will be located within that folder.\r\n\r\nFor Galaxy users who have FTP enabled, this plugin works well. Just set the default to your Galaxy FTP server and after the transfer is complete log in and go to data import and under the FTP section you should see your data that has been imported."}
